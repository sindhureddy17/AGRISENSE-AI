Key Components of AgriSense AI Smart Farming:
ðŸŒ¾ Smart Soil Monitoring:
Utilizing IoT sensors, AgriSense provides real-time tracking of critical soil parameters such as moisture, pH levels, and nutrients. This data helps farmers maintain optimal soil health and make timely interventions to improve crop growth.

ðŸ¦  AI-Based Pest & Disease Detection:
The project integrates Edge AI cameras that monitor crops for early signs of pests and diseases. By using AI models to detect issues before they spread, farmers receive instant alerts, allowing for quick and targeted pest management, reducing crop loss and pesticide usage.

ðŸ’§ Automated Irrigation Systems:
AgriSense employs AI-driven irrigation systems that optimize water usage based on real-time soil moisture and weather data. This reduces water waste and ensures crops receive the right amount of irrigation, particularly during dry spells.

ðŸŒ¤ Weather Prediction & Yield Forecasting:
AgriSense uses AI models to predict local weather conditions and forecast crop yields. By integrating this data into their daily planning, farmers can make proactive decisions, such as adjusting planting schedules, irrigation, and pest control measures, to maximize yields.

ðŸ“Š Smart Marketplace Integration:
AgriSense offers an AI-powered marketplace that connects farmers directly with buyers. This feature allows for dynamic pricing based on real-time supply and demand, ensuring farmers get fair market prices for their produce while reducing reliance on middlemen.

Mission:
AgriSense AI is committed to enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability by empowering farmers with the tools to make data-driven decisions. The project focuses on improving yield, reducing resource waste, and boosting profitability, all while promoting environmental sustainability. Through technology, AgriSense AI seeks to create a future where farming is more efficient, resilient, and profitable for farmers of all sizes.

Impact:
AgriSense AI is poised to help farmers adapt to changing environmental conditions, optimize resource use, and improve crop yields, ultimately contributing to food security and sustainable agricultural practices. The integration of AI, IoT, and Edge Computing in agriculture is a transformative step towards modernizing the industry, making it more resilient, data-driven, and efficient
